Challenge: Timed Transmission

Category: Hardware

Description: As part of your initialization sequence, your team loaded various tools into your system, but you still need to learn how to use them effectively. They have tasked you with the challenge of finding the appropriate tool to open a file containing strange serial signals. Can you rise to the challenge and find the right tool?

My First Thoughts: Ok this is a very-easy rated challenge let's finish it off quickly.

Solution: So I was pretty surprised after solving this challenge because the solution was super non-technical (and maybe I was over-complicating alot of things). 
There are only downloadable files for this challenge so you just download the zip file and extract it and you get a .sal file. For people who are not from a hardware hacking background,
.sal files are simply saleae capture files and such files usually contain data signals that are passed on from the source to destination. To open such files you require a software namely, Saleae Logic Analyzer (V2). 
The Logic 1 can only open .logicdata file and not .sal files so keep a note of that. Now after you open the file in Saleae logic analyzer you can see 5 data channels. 
So now to get on how to solve the challenge, all you have to do is zoom in a specific amount so that the 5 data channels form some text like shown the picture. And you have to somehow make out the flag. For the ones who couldn't figure out the flag here's the flag.
Flag: HTB{b391N_tH3_HArdWAr3_QU3St} Yea I also had to do some bruteforcing and stuff to actually get the flag because I confused S for 5, b for 6, etc.
